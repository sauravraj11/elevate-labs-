This simple Java program is a basic calculator. I built it to understand how to create methods for different tasks (like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing). You type in two numbers and then tell the program what you want to do with them (+, -, *, or /). It will then show you the answer. I also made sure it tells you if you try to divide by zero, which is a common mistake. This project helped me learn about getting input from the user and making decisions in my code, which are important first steps in programming!

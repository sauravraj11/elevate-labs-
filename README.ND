This is a basic Java program to manage student records from the command line.
You can add new students, see all student details, update any student's information, or delete a student record. 
Each student has an ID, name, age, and department. The program runs in a loop until you choose to exit.
It’s a good practice project if you’re learning Java and want to understand how to take input, use classes, and work with data.
To use it, run the program in your terminal — it’s simple, fast, and works right in your command line.
